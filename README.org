* Archlinux Bootstrap [[https://travis-ci.org/EricCrosson/archlinux-install.svg?branch=master]]

Inspired by [[https://github.com/wuputah][wuputah]]'s vm-bootstrapping [[https://gist.github.com/wuputah/4982514][gist]], this script interfaces with
the [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch GNU/Linux]] installer shell and provisions a simple, working system.

This is not intended to be as robust as an infrastructure-as-code solution.
It came mostly assembled, and every time I use it I automate a little bit more.

** Installation

You can dump this into your shell to run the script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricCrosson/archlinux-install/master/archlinux-install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

Or, if you prefer editing the script first:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wget -O installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricCrosson/archlinux-install/master/archlinux-install.sh && \
  chmod +x installer.sh && \
  vim installer.sh && ./installer.sh
#+END_SRC
