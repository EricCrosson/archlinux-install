* Archlinux Bootstrap

Inspired by [[https://github.com/wuputah][wuputah]]'s vm-bootstrapping [[https://gist.github.com/wuputah/4982514][gist]], this script interfaces with
the [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch GNU/Linux]] installer shell and provisions a simple, working system.

This is not intended to be as robust as an infrastructure-as-code solution.
It came mostly assembled, and every time I use it I automate a little bit more.

** Installation

You can dump this into your shell to run the script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # TODO: get link
#+END_SRC

** Command line switches
